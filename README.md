1. Project Setup
Step 1: Initialize the Project
Frontend: Use Create React App or Vite to initialize the React project.
Command: npx create-react-app learnhub-frontend or npm create vite@latest learnhub-frontend --template react
Backend: Initialize a Node.js Express app.
Command: mkdir learnhub-backend && cd learnhub-backend && npm init -y
Step 2: Set Up Version Control
Initialize a Git repository for both frontend and backend.
git init
Create a GitHub repository for both parts of the project.
Step 3: Set Up the Database
Database Choice: Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing course data, user information, etc.
Use Supabase or MongoDB Atlas for cloud database services.
Set up tables for users, courses, enrollments, etc.
2. Frontend Development (React)
2.1 Landing Page & Course Overview
Create Landing Page (Homepage)
Sections:
Header: With site logo, navigation links.
Hero Section: Introduction to the website with a "Get Started" button.
Course Overview: Display top-rated courses with preview cards.
Responsive Design:
Use Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.
Example for a landing page using Tailwind:
jsx
Copy code
<div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Welcome to Learnhub</h1>
  <p className="text-xl mt-2">Explore courses and enhance your skills!</p>
  <button className="mt-4 p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Browse Courses</button>
</div>
2.2 Authentication (Login/Signup)
User Authentication (using Supabase)
Set up authentication pages for Sign Up, Log In, and Forgot Password.
Use Supabase for handling user authentication.
Redirect logged-in users to the dashboard or home page.
js
Copy code
// Example in App.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
    setUser(session?.user ?? null);
  });
}, []);
2.3 Course Dashboard & Enrollment
Courses Listing Page:
Display courses using a card layout.
Each course card shows the course title, instructor, and a short description.
jsx
Copy code
// Example course card in Course.tsx
<div className="card">
  <h3>{course.title}</h3>
  <p>{course.description}</p>
  <button onClick={() => enrollCourse(course.id)}>Enroll</button>
</div>
Course Enrollment:
When a user clicks on a course, redirect them to the course details page.
Allow users to enroll in the course.
2.4 Profile Page
User Profile Page:
Display user information such as name, email, and enrolled courses.
Allow users to update their profile and change their password.
2.5 Course Content (Video, Quizzes, etc.)
Course Page:
Display course video or content.
Add interactive quizzes to the course.
jsx
Copy code
// Example Course Page
const CoursePage = ({ courseId }) => {
  const [course, setCourse] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCourseDetails(courseId).then((data) => setCourse(data));
  }, [courseId]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{course.title}</h2>
      <video src={course.videoUrl} controls />
      <Quiz courseId={courseId} />
    </div>
  );
};
3. Backend Development (Express)
3.1 Set Up the Express Server
Create routes for authentication:
User Routes: POST /register, POST /login, GET /profile
Course Routes: GET /courses, POST /enroll, GET /courses/:id
3.2 Database Integration
Connect to Database (Supabase/MongoDB)
Set up models for courses, users, and enrollments.
js
Copy code
// Example Supabase Query to fetch courses
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('courses').select('*');
Course CRUD Operations
Create, Read, Update, and Delete courses.
3.3 Socket for Real-Time Updates
Real-time Updates for Course Enrollment:
Use WebSockets or Supabase’s real-time features to update the UI when a new course is added or a user enrolls in a course.
Example with Supabase:
js
Copy code
supabase
  .channel('courses')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'courses' }, fetchCourses)
  .subscribe();
3.4 Payment Integration
Payment Gateway (Stripe):
Integrate a payment system for users to pay for premium courses.
Use Stripe’s API to create checkout sessions and handle payments.
js
Copy code
// Example Stripe Payment Request
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usd',
        product_data: {
          name: 'Course Name',
        },
        unit_amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: 'payment',
  success_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/success`,
  cancel_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/cancel`,
});
4. Deployment
4.1 Frontend Deployment
Deploy Frontend on Vercel or Netlify:
Push the code to GitHub and connect it to Vercel/Netlify.
Configure the environment variables (e.g., Supabase URL and API key).
4.2 Backend Deployment
Deploy Backend on Heroku or DigitalOcean:
Push your backend to a platform like Heroku.
Ensure environment variables like your Supabase URL, Stripe keys, and database credentials are set.
4.3 CI/CD Setup
GitHub Actions: Set up CI/CD pipelines for both frontend and backend to automate deployment.
5. Features & Enhancements
Admin Dashboard:

Admins can create and manage courses, view user progress, and track enrollments.
Course Review System:

Allow users to rate and review courses after completing them.
Push Notifications:

Send push notifications to users when a course they are enrolled in is updated or when new courses are added.
User Progress Tracking:

Track user progress in each course, such as completed lessons or quiz scores.
